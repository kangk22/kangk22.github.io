        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          For my assignment 1 project, I built a circuit that makes 4 LEDs blink in a wave pattern 
          using an Arduino. This page documents my:

      <h2>Schematic and Circuit</h2>
      <p>This assignment required that the circuit use 3 or more LEDs. The current flowing through the 
        LEDs should be limited using resistors, and each LED should also be able to blink independently.
        <br/><br/>
        During one of the lectures in class, we learned about circuits being in series vs. in parallel.
        When a circuit is in series, the current has to flow through each component one after another,
        meaning if one component fails, the entire circuit fails. On the other hand, when a circuit is in parallel,
        the current can flow through multiple paths, so if one component fails, the rest of the circuit can still function.
      </p>

      <h3>My schematic</h3>
      <p>
        I decided to build a circuit with 4 LEDs in parallel, as this would allow each LED to blink independently
        without affecting the others. I also wanted to make the LEDs blink in a wave-like pattern, so I planned to have
        the LEDs turn on with a short delay in between each, and then all turn off with a similar delay.
        <br/><br/>
        Below is a schematic I drew that represents my circuit. At the top of my schematic are the 4 digital pins 
        I would use to give power to the breadboard. Each pin then connects to a resistor, which limits the current as 
        it connects to a LED. Finally, the bottom of my schematic represents when all 4 LEDs connect to join with 
        the ground pin of the Arduino.
      </p>

      <h3>My circuit</h3>
      <p>With my schematic complete, it was now time to implement it as a circuit on my breadboard. I grabbed a red, yellow,
        green, and blue LED, 4 resistors (the next section explains how I calculated the values), 
        and some jumper wires from my Arduino starter kit and started building the circuit of one LED first.
        <br/><br/>
        I used a black wire to connect the GND pin on the Arduino to the the negative row on my breadboard.
        I then used a red wire to connect the 5V pin on the Arduino to one of the inside rows of the breadboard, and along 
        that same row number, I placed one end of a resistor. I used the other end of the resistor to determine 
        where to place the longer leg of the red LED, as this leg needed to be connected to the positive voltage. 
        The other leg of the LED needed to be connected to the ground, so I used one more wire to connect the 
        shorter leg to the ground row on my breadboard.
        <img src="assets/red-led.png" height="600px"/>
        To test if my circuit was working, I gave power to the Arduino by connecting it to my laptop via USB, and I saw that 
        the red LED had successfully turned on. I repeated the same steps for the other three LEDs, but instead of using the 5V pin 
        for power, I used digital pins 8, 9, 10, and 11 on the Arduino to connect to the red, yellow, green, and blue LEDs respectively.
        <br><br/>
        Overall, my circuit runs 4 LEDs in parallel. Each LED is connected to a digital pin on the 
        Arduino (pins 8-11) and their current is limited with a resistor. The other end of each LED is connected to 
        the ground pin on the Arduino.

      </p>

      <h3>Calculating resistance</h3>
      <p>To calculate what resistance to use for each LED, I used Ohm's law (V = IR) to solve for R.
        In class, we learned that diodes (which LEDs are a type of) have a voltage drop, meaning some volts are "lost"
        when the diode is operating. Thus, I looked up the voltage drop for each LED color and subtracted that 
        from the Arduino's operating voltage of 5V. Alongside the desired current of 20mA, I was able to
        calculate the resistance needed for each LED.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/calculations.jpg" height="450px" />
      <p>Finally, I used the calculated resistance to find the resistor with the nearest value. We also learned that
        it's better to shoot a little higher if needed, so I found the next highest resistor that came in my Arduino 
        starter kit. In the end, I used a 220 ohm resistor for the red, yellow, and green LEDs and a 100 ohm resistor 
        for the blue LED.

      <h2>Code Snippet</h2>
      <p>I started my code with the built-in example sketch "Blink" provided by the Arduino IDE. Originally, it only
        had one pinMode set to pin 13, and the loop function turned the LED on and off with a 1 second delay.
        I modified the code to initialize 4 digital pins (8-11) as outputs for my 4 LEDs, and in the loop, I created two
        functions to turn each LED on and off in ascending order with a 0.1 second delay in between. This created a wave-like
        blinking pattern at a faster speed than the original sketch.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="cpp">
        // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
        void setup() {
          // initialize digital pins as an output.
          pinMode(8, OUTPUT);     // red LED
          pinMode(9, OUTPUT);     // yellow LED
          pinMode(10, OUTPUT);    // green LED
          pinMode(11, OUTPUT);    // blue LED
        }

        // the loop function runs over and over again forever
        void loop() {
          // turns on each LED from pins 8 to 11 in ascending order with a 0.1 second delay
          for (int i = 8; i < 12; i++) {
            digitalWrite(i, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
            delay(100);            // wait for 0.1 sec
          }

          // turns off each LED from pins 8 to 11 in ascending order with a 0.1 second delay
          for (int i = 8; i < 12; i++) {
            digitalWrite(i, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
            delay(100);           // wait for 0.1 sec 
          }
        }

      <h2>Circuit Operation</h2>
      <p>
        With everything complete, I uploaded my code to the Arduino and powered it on. <br/>
        The circuit worked as expected (yay :D),
        and you can see the final result in the GIFs below.

    <div id="additional-questions">
      <hr class="invisible"/>
      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <p class="bold">1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs.
        Draw a line for each of your LEDs.
      </p>
      <p>The graph below shows the voltage across each LED over time. The color of the lines represents the color of 
        the LEDs. All LEDs turn on (at 5V) for 0.4 seconds before turning off (at 0V) and waiting for another 
        0.4 seconds, and they are offset by 0.1 second intervals to create the wave pattern. The entire pattern repeats between
        0 and 0.8 seconds.
      </p>
      <img src="assets/graph.jpg" height="600px" />

      <p class="bold">2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino?
        How much current would that draw?
      </p>
      <p>LEDs can only blink independently if they are connected to a unique digital pin.
        Since the Arduino has 14 digital pins, I could blink up to 14 LEDs independently. 
        As for how much current that would draw, I can calculate that with: <br/>
        14 LEDs * 20mA each = 280mA total current drawn.
      </p>

      <p class="bold">3: How many LEDs could you blink with your Arduino if only
        one were to be on at once? (optional)
      </p>
      <p>I'm not too sure, so I'm going to skip this question :p</p>

      <p class="bold">4: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until 
        you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
      </p>
      <p>I tested this out by shortening the delays written in my code. At 5 milliseconds, the LEDs were 
        blinking so fast that I couldn't see the wave pattern anymore. At 3 milliseconds, the  LEDs 
        didn't turn off completely but became slightly dimmer. Finally, at 2 milliseconds, the LEDs
        appeared to be constantly on.
      </p>
      
      <p class="bold">5: Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? 
        If yes, please provide details on how/when, as well as a brief reflection. 
        If no, you can either leave this question blank, or provide other information if you'd like.
      </p>
      <p>I did not intentially use any generative AI like ChatGPT for this assignment.
        However, I did accept a lot of the suggestions given by CoPilot, which is Visual Studio Code's AI tool.
        It helped me auto-complete code snippets, fix formatting mistakes, and even write out entire sentences at times.
